Natural Language to Code Translator with WorqHat AI
Hey there, fam! Welcome to WorqHat, where we're about to embark on an exciting course that will take your AI skills to the next level!
In this course, we'll be diving into the fascinating world of AI bots, specifically focusing on building our very own AI bot using the incredible AiCon V2 Model from WorqHat AI. And let me tell you, this bot is not your average bot. It's a bot that can transform your thoughts into actual code in any programming language you desire! Yes, you heard it right.
Imagine being able to express your ideas or describe the code you want to generate, either in Hindi or English, and have the bot magically generate the code for you in your preferred programming language. It's like having your own personal coding assistant!
This project is significant because it will not only equip you with the knowledge and skills to build AI-based projects but also give you a fundamental understanding of how to leverage the latest APIs provided by WorqHat. Trust me, this is going to be a cool and game-changing experience!
Now, let's take a sneak peek into the world of the one and only Code Translator, a project that will revolutionize the way you approach coding. Get ready to be amazed!
But don't take my word for it, you gotta try it out for yourself. We've got a live code translator on this website, that's already causing a stir. People can't get enough of it! So, before you even start this course, go check it out and see what all the fuss is about.So, are you ready to step up and take on the challenge? Let's do this!

What you'll learn
We will:
Cover some super cool basic understanding of AI, WorqHatAI, and AiCon models.
We will set up the development environment with WorqHatAI, NodeJS, and NextJS
We will write text completion models in NodeJS using amazing WorqHat AiCon V2 models.
We will build a responsive front-end app in NextJS and back-end that uses OpenAI API and interacts with front-end, then we will run it
Prerequisites
Learning new technologies becomes easier when you have some prior knowledge. Before diving into WorqHatAI and AI model development, we recommend brushing up on the following areas:
Programming Knowledge: Having a basic understanding of programming is essential to start experimenting with advanced languages. While not mandatory, knowledge of the JavaScript programming language is considered a plus.
Critical Thinking: To grasp the complex and abstract concepts involved in WorqHat APIs and AI development, solid critical thinking skills are beneficial. Developing your ability to analyze, evaluate, and solve problems will greatly aid your learning process.
However, don't worry if you don't possess all the prerequisite knowledge beforehand. You can still learn API and AI model development without prior expertise. It's just that having some background knowledge will make your learning experience smoother and more enjoyable.
